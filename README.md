## Overview
CANNABOT is a chat-bot designed to recommend the perfect cannabis strains based on individual patient needs. Developed as part of our Bachelor's Degree final project, CANNABOT leverages OpenAI API, Twilio integration, Python programming, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver accurate and personalized recommendations.

## Features
* Personalized Recommendations: Using a custom dataset, CANNABOT provides tailored strain suggestions based on user input.
* OpenAI API Integration: Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user queries.
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhances the botâ€™s capabilities by retrieving relevant information from the dataset and generating precise responses.
* Twilio Integration: Enables seamless communication via WhatsApp for users to interact with the chat-bot.

## Technologies Used
* Python: Core programming language used to develop the bot.
* OpenAI API: For natural language understanding and generating human-like responses.
* RAG: Combines retrieval mechanisms with generative models to provide more accurate and contextually relevant recommendations.
* Twilio API: For WhatsApp communication, enabling users to interact with the bot via text messages.

## How It Works
* User Input: The user inputs their requirements (e.g., medical conditions, preferences).
* Processing: CANNABOT processes the input using NLP models and searches the custom dataset.
* Recommendation: The bot provides personalized strain recommendations directly to the user via WhatsApp.

## Code

Unfortunately, the code is currently private due to privacy concerns. We hope to make it public in the future.
